Bot under development, every contribution is accepted and can be forked. Bot intended for personal discord guild and educational purposes. The code contains a high level of spanglish code because I'm still learning :|

## Running the bot.
At the moment bot is not hosted but it will be soon. To run the bot, clone or fork the repo. Then do:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
After installing libraries run file main.py using IDLE or any other python console. Mandatory Python 3.8+. If any library is remaining, just do a quick `pip install <library>`.

## Required environment variables.
For bigobot to work proper, populate a .env file with:
- [Discord Bot Token ](https://discord.com/developers/applications) as (TOKEN)
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) as (OWM_API_KEY)
- [Tracker.gg API](https://tracker.gg/developers/apps) as (TRN-API-KEY)
- [Genius Lyrics API](https://genius.com/api-clients) as (GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN)
- Instagram login credentials if desired instagram command to work properly. 

## To-do:
- [x] Add requirements.txt
- [] Clean the code.
- [] Add more cogs.
- [] Add both english and spanish support.
- [x] Upload to hosting 24/7 (partially).
